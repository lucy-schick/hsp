# Safe Work Procedures and Practices

## Driving {#driving .Style1}

### General Procedures and Practices

-   Conduct a "pre-trip" vehicle check. Use a Vehicle Pre-trip
    Inspection and Mileage Log to track activity. Report deficiencies and do not use if equipment is in unsafe condition.
    
-   Ensure you have all the required vehicle safety equipment which can be found in Table \@ref(tab:driving-equip).

-   Make notes of required maintenance in the mileage logbook when it is
    required and include "checking the logbook for required repairs" at
    the time of each inspection.

-   Drive defensively at all times.

-   Ensure all vehicle occupants are wearing seatbelts. You are
    responsible for your passengers.

-   Do not exceed posted speed limits.
* Avoid night driving when possible, never drive when distracted or overly fatigued. Limiting the length of field days can help reduce the risk of injury when driving. 

-   Drive safely and drive to the existing road conditions. Lower speed
    as required. Stay home if conditions are hazardous and risk of injury is high. Be aware of:

    -   Visibility reduced by dust, fog, rain, snow;

    -   Narrow roads with over width vehicles;

    -   Steep favorable and adverse gradients;

    -   Slippery and variable road surface conditions due to loose
        gravel, snow, ice or mud;

    -   Other users, wildlife

-   The inside of the windshield should be cleaned regularly to prevent glare, and condensation should be wiped away before driving, with each field vehicle equipped with paper towels or a cleaning cloth for on-the-go cleaning.

-   Use vehicle for intended use only (purpose and weight limitations).

-   Drive with vehicle lights on at all times.

-   Secure all heavy or sharp objects in the cab of the vehicle.

-   Respect that loaded logging trucks have the right of way on single
    lane roads.

- Tailgating—driving too closely behind another vehicle—is extremely dangerous and increases the risk of collisions, especially if the vehicle in front brakes suddenly or is involved in an accident. Always maintain a safe following distance, with extra space for larger vehicles like logging trucks. A good rule of thumb is to allow at least 3–4 seconds between when the vehicle ahead passes a fixed point and when you reach the same spot.

-   Never chase a runaway vehicle.

-   Stay on your side of the road.

* Avoid distracted driving, do not use cell phone unless stopped and parked safely.

    **COVID 19 (COVID)**

    -   [Self-assess daily for COVID
        symptoms](https://bc.thrive.health/covid19/en) and self-isolate
        and test if you have symptoms.

    -   When possible, travel in separate vehicles. When a crew is
        required to travel together, sit in seats as far from eachother
        as possible, wear masks and when possible leave the windows open
        for good ventilation.

    -   All vehicles need to have paper towel, min 70% alcohol hand
        sanitizer and non-medical grade masks. Ensure this is present
        before leaving.

    -   When getting in vehicle wipe down all initial touch points with
        min 70% alcohol and paper towel (ex. Vehicle door, radio,
        steering wheel, shifter, seat belt). Sanitize all surfaces of
        both hands.

    -   After opening vehicle door at all stops and worksites use hand
        sanitizer on surfaces of both hands. Put on non-medical mask if
        entering building (ex. Gas station, restaurants) or working with
        others where you cannot keep min 2m distance. Upon exiting
        vehicle close door with elbow.

### Resource Road Safety

-   Do not exceed 80kph or posted speed limits. Drive at a safe and controlled speed, and avoid sudden maneuvers.

-   Pass trucks or equipment only after you receive a clearly visible and/or audible signal from the operator.

* Drive with headlights on at all times, whether it's day or night, good or bad visibility. 

* Ensure you have the necessary equipment on board in case of emergencies, see Table \@ref(tab:driving-equip).

* Before heading out, research and plan your route. Check for potential hazards, weather conditions, and local regulations or restrictions.

* Familiarize yourself with your vehicle's capabilities and limitations for off-road terrain. Ensure you have proper all terrain tires. Be aware of ground clearance, approach and departure angles, and four-wheel-drive systems.

### Radio Use

-   Complete radio check and ensure correct frequency prior to entering
    radio controlled area.

-   Do not drive on radio controlled roads without the radio on and turned up. Expect oncoming traffic at all times.

-   Call your position according to the local radio protocol and
    signage.

-   Notify other radio equipped vehicles of oncoming non-radio equipped
    traffic.

-   Do not use road radio channels for conversations, use only for road
    traffic protocols.

-   Other than traffic control, pull over and safely park when talking
    on the radio for an extended period of time.

### Parking and Key Management

* When working in the field, it is important to manage your keys. Always carry a spare key and keep it hidden somewhere on the vehicle that can be accessed if keys are lost. As a good practice and particularly important if you do not have a spare key - hide primary keys somewhere on your vehicle. Choose a location that is hard to see but easy to reach (ex: in gas cap or under bumper). Notify your co workers where they are in case of emergency.

-   Park clear of traffic, away from active areas in pullouts or extra
    wide straight sections of road.

-   Park facing the direction of exit with access for service/towing
    activities.

-   Ensure the parking brake is on and the transmission is in 1st gear
    or park.

-   On steep grades, use wheel chocks and always turn the wheels towards
    the nearest ditch.

-   Never park on a curve especially on the outside curve of a road.

-   When turning around, back into the cut bank of the road and not
    towards the outside bank.

-   Use flares where required.

## Electrofishing {#electrofishing .Style1}

### Preparatory Procedures

1.  A crew leader must be designated for all backpack electrofishing
    activities.

2.  It is the crew leader's responsibility to ensure that all equipment
    is in "safe working order".

3.  An emergency response plan must be prepared and reviewed with all
    crew members.

4.  The crew leader must ensure all crew members have received
    instruction in the fundamentals of electrofishing safety.

5.  The crew leader and at least one additional crew member must have
    up-to-date CPR and First Aid training.

6.  Each electrofishing site must be visually inspected for hazards such
    as deep holes, submerged logs, etc. before commencing electrofishing
    operations.

7.  In order to aid in identifying underwater hazards, all crew members
    must be equipped with polarized sunglasses. Glasses also protect
    against eye injury caused by sticks and branches. Wide brimmed hats
    or peaked caps are also beneficial in increasing the effectiveness
    of polarized glasses.

8.  All crew members must be equipped with long armed gloves that are
    non-conductive, waterproof and inspected to be free of leaks. Gloves
    must be worn at all times during electrofishing operations.

9.  All crew members must be equipped with chest waders that are
    non-conductive, waterproof and inspected to be free of leaks. Chest
    waders must be worn at all times during electrofishing operations by
    team members entering the water. Wading belts are to be worn at all
    times.

10. All crew members must agree on a system of communication during
    electrofishing operations.

11. Backpack electrofishing units must be turned off and the battery
    disconnected before making any connections or part replacements.
    Start-up Procedures

12. All crew members must be notified and acknowledge their preparedness
    prior to the commencement of electrofishing operations. The unit
    operator must make sure that personnel are clear of the anode before
    turning on the power. Hand signals are a useful way of conveying
    these messages.

13. Check operation of all switches and gauges. This should include high
    voltage check, anode switch, power switch and mercury tilt switch,
    audible tone generator and light. Set controls to appropriate
    levels. The minimum voltage possible to obtain the desired results
    should be used to avoid excessive harm to the biota and to minimize
    the effects of accidental shock.

### Operational Procedures

14. Operate slowly and carefully. Footing in most streams is poor and
    most falls occur when crew members are hurrying. Operations should
    cease when fatigue sets in.

15. Team members must not place their hand(s) into the water when the
    power is turned on.

16. Electrofishing units must be shut off prior to entering or leaving
    the water and the battery terminals disconnected (or generator shut
    off) when not in use or when transporting the unit.

17. Life jackets or Personal Floatation Devices (PFDs) must be worn
    where the crew leader considers the water is of sufficient depth or
    velocity for a life jacket or PFD to be effective as protection from
    risk of drowning. Life jackets and PFDs must be approved by
    Transport Canada or Canadian Coast Guard. Electrofishing should not
    be carried out where water depth is greater than waist deep.

18. A crew member must immediately leave the water if wetness is
    detected in gloves or waders (by leaks, rain or perspiration) and
    obtain dry equipment before returning. Mild dampness from
    perspiration or humidity is considered normal.

19. Electrofishing operations must cease during inclement weather. (e.g.
    periods of any lightning or moderate rain).

**COVID 19**

-   As electrofishing often requires the "fisher" and "netter" to be
    within 2m of eachother masks are required to be worn by both crew
    members.

-   Wear disposable gloves when assembling equipment or wipe down all
    touch points after assembly.


## Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) {#uav .Style1}

To ensure safe and responsible operation of UAVs (drones), the following procedures must be adhered to at all times:

### Pre-Flight Planning and Communication
- Check in with local aviation companies and stakeholders to confirm flight plans, identify potential airspace conflicts, and determine lines of sight.
- Verify the UAV is not operating within restricted airspace without authorization. Ensure compliance with Transport Canada regulations and confirm proximity to airports or aerodromes.
- Utilize resources such as [FltPlan Go](https://www.fltplan.com/) ([iOS app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/fltplan-go/id694832363)) to assess airspace classification and identify potential flight restrictions.

### Crew Training Requirements
- All crew members involved in UAV operations must have the proper training and certifications as required by [Transport Canada](https://tc.canada.ca/en/aviation/drone-safety/learn-rules-you-fly-your-drone).
- UAV pilots must hold a valid [Transport Canada license](https://tc.canada.ca/en/aviation/drone-safety/drone-pilot-licensing) appropriate for the class of UAV being operated. All currently used UAVs require both a licensed operator and [drone registration](https://tc.canada.ca/en/aviation/drone-safety/registering-your-drone).
- Crew members should be familiar with the UAV equipment, operating procedures, and emergency protocols.
- Maintain compliance with Transport Canada requirements for ongoing pilot licensing and drone registration, including any necessary renewals or certifications.

### Use of Aviation Radios
- Equip the team with an aviation radio and tune it to the appropriate local aviation frequency. Conduct a pre-flight radio check to ensure clear communication and situational awareness.
- A valid [radio license](https://ised-isde.canada.ca/site/spectrum-management-telecommunications/en/licences-and-certificates/radio-authorizations/radio-operator-certification/restricted-operator-certificate-aeronautical-roc) is required to operate an aeronautical radio.
- Radio channels should be sourced from the FltPlan Go app or other official aviation sources.

### Equipment and Operational Safety
- Maintain a visual line of sight with the UAV at all times during flight.
- Avoid potential interference by Keeping the UAV controller and aeronautical radio separate when operating the drone.  
- Ensure the UAV is equipped with appropriate lighting for visibility if operating in low-light conditions.
- Monitor weather conditions and avoid flying in high winds, rain, or other hazardous weather.
- Immediately land the UAV if another aircraft enters the area or if situational awareness is compromised.
- Endure you have all the required equipment which can be found in Table \@ref(tab:uav-eq).

### Flight Logging and Record-Keeping
- Maintain a logbook for each UAV flight using the [RMUS app](https://www.rmus.com/pages/rmus-uav-pilot-preflight-compliance-checklist?) on an iPhone.
- Export flight reports regularly and store them in a designated repository or other secure location for record-keeping and compliance.

<br>

By following these procedures, UAV operations will be conducted safely and responsibly, minimizing risks to personnel, equipment, and other airspace users.

## Culvert and habitat confirmation assessments {#culvert-assessments-and-habitat-confirmation-assessments .Style1}

See driving procedures including radio use and parking.

-   Sometime parking on the shoulder of resource roads is the only
    practical way to assess a site. When doing so place a traffic cone
    2m behind the back left wheel to alert oncoming traffic.

-   Wear waders and wading boots or a non-slip rubber boot when working
    in the stream. Carefully assess your footing and be ready for
    slippery surfaces.

-   Use 2 walking poles when conducting in stream surveys. Always maintain 3 points of contact with poles and your feet. This allows
    for much greater stability and avoids the risk of injury. As the in
    stream substrate typically consists of cobbles and boulders, it can
    be very painful when falling. Be cautious of foot placement to lower risk of foot entrapment. Poles are often used in photos to have
    a frame of reference for measurements of stream characteristics. One
    pole can be used for scale, while the other one can remain in hand
    as a stabilizer.

-   Carry bear spray with you at all times when in the field. You never
    know when you'll need to use it.

-   Always carry personal first aid kit, water, extra clothes, inreach
    satellite communicator and food (ex. Power bar) in your vest in case
    of an emergency.

-   High visibility field vest should be worn to avoid being mistaken
    for an animal by hunters.

-   Navigating to sites often requires the use of handheld devices such
    as phones, two-way radios or GPS which should either be used by a
    non-driving crew member or mounted on the windshield where they can
    be viewed without distracting the driver.

-   Touching base with the call in person throughout the day is
    essential so that your last known location is known and to minimize
    the potential for false alarms should you not check in on time at
    the end of the day. Inreaches should be tested between crew members
    and between crew members and check in people before going in the
    field.

## Swiftwater rescue and safety

Most of our field work involves working in small streams or creeks. Sometimes we can find ourselves in larger systems that have fast flowing water. It is important to be prepared and to be safe. Below are some best practices for swiftwater rescue and safety.

* Never put your foot down if you are being swept away. This will prevent foot entrapment.
* Never tie a rope around a rescuer. Attach a line to a quick release strap if present. 
* Always deploy upstream spotters to know what is going to be coming down toward you.
* If you are rescuing someone, wear a PFD and a helmet.  
* Always have a backup plan.
* Never count on the victim to help in his or her own rescue.
* Never tie a tension line at a right angle.
* Never lose contact with the victim.
* In addition to drowning, other dangers in swift water rescues include hypothermia, trauma, remote areas, and frightened victims.
* Water in swift water rescues is powerful but predictable. Marking water levels and understanding factors such as eddies (calm water behind obstructions), hazards (underwater obstructions), and "keepers" (areas where victims may be stuck) can aid decision-making.

It is important to understand the flow of a stream. Understanding where flow velocities are highest will help you navigate watersheds more efficiently and reduce the risk of injury.

Swiftwater rescue PPE equipment list:

* Helmet
* Knife
* Gloves
* PFD with quick release harness
* Drysuit
* Throwbag
* Boots
* Whistle

## Working Alone

Working alone means working in circumstances where assistance would not be readily available to the worker in case of an emergency. There can be circumstances in the field where the worker will be conducting a survey alone. The lone worker must abide by the following procedures:

* Designate a contact person to check in with on a pre planned schedule. Arrange a meet up time and place before getting separated. 

* The worker must carry a functioning communication device such as a cell phone, two-way radio, and a inreach satellite communicator. Carrying all three is highly recommended. Ensure radios are charged fully every second night. When working in areas out of cell range a satellite communicator is required.  

* Carry bear spray. Make a lot of noise periodically to alert bears in the area of your presence. Optionally, it can be effective to have a bluetooth speaker to play music.
    
* If the lone worker fails to check in, then the contact person must initiate search procedures. See Procedures for Failed Check-In section of Field Safety Plan.

* Carry water, food, extra clothes, a first aid kit (with emergency blanket) and materials you would need to make a fire (lighter) in case something unforeseen happens.

### Cougars

* Make a lot of noise when working and walking
* Avoid cougar kills. Cougars cover their kills with dirt and leaves and return later. Be aware for circling birds and other scavengers; these could indicate there is a kill site nearby.
* **If you encounter a cougar:**
  + Don't run, this might trigger a pursuit
  + Don't turn your back, always keep the cougar in front of you
* **If the cougar shows interest in you** (staring, crouching, creeping, tail twitching):
  + Make eye contact
  + Make yourself look big
  + Show your teeth, pretend to be a predator
  + Make loud noises
  + Arm yourself with anything you can find
* **If the cougar attacks:**
  + Fight back, convince the cougar you are the predator and not the prey
  + Yell or make loud, intimidating noises
  + Focus your attacks on the cougar's nose, face, and eyes

### Moose

A moose will charge to ward off a potential threat. Assure the moose that you are not a threat.

* **Signs of an aggressive moose:**
  + Walking in your direction
  + Stomping its feet
  + Peeling its ears back
  + Grunting
  + Throwing its head back and forth
* **How to prevent and survive a moose attack:**
  + Back away with palms facing the moose
  + Speak softly and reassuringly to it
  + If the moose charges then get behind a large tree or rock, most moose charges are bluffs
  + If the moose attacks you then fake death by curling up in a ball, protect your neck and back

## Weather Preparedness

Fieldwork in early fall, particularly through September and October, often involves highly variable environmental conditions. Temperatures can shift rapidly throughout the day, with cold mornings, warm afternoons, and the potential for wind, rain, or even early snowfall. Being prepared for this variability is essential to staying safe and effective in the field.

<br>

All personnel should be equipped with appropriate clothing and gear to manage both cold and warm weather exposure. This includes:

- Layering systems for cold, wet, or changing conditions:
  - Moisture-wicking base layers to manage perspiration
  - Insulating mid-layers (e.g., fleece, wool, or synthetic fill) to retain warmth
  - Waterproof and windproof outer layers for rain and wind protection
  - Toques and insulated gloves to maintain extremity warmth, especially in emergency situations

- Gear for warm, sunny, or exposed conditions:
  - A wide-brimmed hat or cap to reduce heat stress
  - Sunglasses with UV protection to prevent eye damage (should also be polarized for electrofishing purposes)
  - Sunscreen (SPF 30 or higher), applied regularly to all exposed skin
  - Lightweight, breathable layers that offer coverage while allowing ventilation

<br>

Hydration is critical regardless of temperature. All workers must carry sufficient water (we recommend 2 to 3 litres per day), increasing with exertion and heat exposure.

<br>

Daily gear checks are recommended to ensure field crews are equipped for forecasted and unexpected conditions. Preparing for both heat and cold reduces the risk of hypothermia, heat-related illness, sunburn, and other preventable safety concerns.

<br>

Each team member is responsible for managing their own well-being throughout the day. Taking care of your hydration, temperature regulation, and overall preparedness not only protects you, but supports the safety and effectiveness of the entire crew.

## Remote Working

Approximately 75% of the work done at New Graph Environment is remote from the employee's home. Safe work practices are still important when working remotely. 

### Ergonomics

Ergonomics are an important part to any home office. Your home work space should meet basic ergonomic requirements in order to decrease risk of long term injuries. Listed below are a few guidelines:

* It starts with a good chair. Ensure your chair is properly adjusted so that your wrists are straight, with hands below or at elbow level, knees are level with hips and thighs parallel to the floor, feet are flat on the ground, and the top of your computer display is positioned at or just below eye level. Get a chair with proper lumbar support.
* Invest in a good mouse and keyboard that offer good wrist support and comfort.
* Buy a proper desk that has enough room for all your equipment and is of appropriate height. Adjustable desks are a good option since you can switch between sitting and standing positions.
* Do not sit in one place all day long. Make sure you get up and walk around and/or stretch throughout the day to relieve muscle and joint pain. 

### Health and Wellness

When working remotely, it is important to maintain your mental and physical health. 
Listed below are a few ways to reduce stress and improve your mental and physical health:

* Stick to a regular work schedule and routine that works for you. Make sure you give yourself time to switch off on your down time.
* Take a break every now and then to get up and walk around. A great tool for this is [Be Focused](https://apps.apple.com/au/app/be-focused-pomodoro-timer/id973134470?mt=12) which allows you to set work intervals and break intervals.
* If a task you're working on is causing you too much stress then don't be afraid to delegate or ask for help, avoid burnout and overworking yourself.
* Stick to a good work life balance, make time for socializing, enjoying your favorite hobbies, doing exercise, or whatever self care looks like for you. 
* Working remotely can mean a lot of time on your own so its especially important to make sure you are getting enough social connection. Consider building in social time throughout your day, whether it be a phone call with a friend or a post work activity. 
* Sun exposure is limited when working inside and it can therefore be hard to get your daily Vitamin D requirements, consider taking a supplement.
* Seasonal affective disorder can affect everyone and can cause a decrease in energy levels and change in mood in the winter time. Try to go outside everyday and engage in regular physical activity to reduce stress levels.
* When leaving the house to go to a work related meeting be aware of road conditions when driving, even when walking (steer clear of ice to avoid nasty falls).

### Burnout

Burnout is real! The first steps to avoiding burnout is to notice it, here are some common signs of burnout:

* Feeling exhausted, whether it be physical, mental, or emotional.
* Felling cynical and detached from work.
* Felling ineffective and unaccomplished.

If you are feeling any of these symptoms then it is important to take a step back and re-evaluate your work life balance. Here are some things you can do to avoid burnout:

* Prioritize your self-care practices. This can include regular exercise, a healthy diet, and getting enough sleep.
* Try to shift your perspective on work. Find tasks you can complete and feel good about. Considering asking yourself which tasks you could delegate to others to free up meaningful time and energy for other important work.
* Minimize your exposure to stressors. This can include setting boundaries with your work, taking regular breaks, and avoiding overworking yourself.
* Seek support from others. This can include talking to a friend, family member, or a mental health professional.
